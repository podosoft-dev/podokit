# Deployment profile

The profile at `.podokit/deploy/<name>.json` is application-owned and contains no Secret values.

## kubernetes-helm (default)

Initialize it with an explicit kubeconfig context:

```bash
npx @podosoft/podokit deploy init --profile production --context production --host app.example.com
```

Review the target, immutable API/web repositories, exposure, workloads, dependency modes, API/optional web Secret names and required keys, non-sensitive runtime configuration, and verification checks before planning.

The cluster namespace and referenced Secrets must already exist. PodoKit asks `kubectl` to output only Secret key names and never prints or stores their values; the Kubernetes client still materializes the Secret while evaluating that output.

Required keys:

| Secret | Required keys |
| --- | --- |
| API | Profile-declared keys plus enabled dependency connection keys: `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |
| web | Only explicitly declared web keys; omitted by default |
| PostgreSQL dependency | `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB` |
| Redis dependency | `REDIS_PASSWORD` |
| Object storage dependency | `MINIO_ROOT_USER`, `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |
| image pull | A `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret |

Use `inCluster` when the generated Helm release should manage a dependency, `external` when application configuration points to an existing service, and `disabled` only when the application does not require it.

Use the same stable SemVer tag for API and web. `latest`, branch tags, and empty tags are rejected. Planning resolves every deployed tag to an immutable registry digest through Docker Buildx.

## docker-compose

Initialize it with an explicit Docker context. The context may be local or `ssh://`,
and it is pinned by a fingerprint of the endpoint plus the daemon ID, so repointing
it at a different host invalidates the profile instead of deploying somewhere else.

```bash
npx @podosoft/podokit deploy init \
  --profile production \
  --driver docker-compose \
  --context production \
  --host app.example.com \
  --secrets-dir /etc/podokit/example-app
```

The fields that differ from the Kubernetes driver:

- `target`: Docker context, endpoint fingerprint, Compose project name
- `exposure`: `bindAddress` and `port` published from the web service. It defaults to
  `127.0.0.1`, because the expected front door is a reverse proxy on the same host —
  binding every interface publishes the app before TLS exists
- `workloads`: replicas plus Compose `cpus` and `memory` limits
- `dependencies`: `managed`, `external`, or `disabled`, each with a named Docker
  volume and the path of its env file on the target host
- `secrets`: env-file paths and required key names, plus `registryLogin`

Credentials live in env files **on the target host**, never in the profile and never
in the rendered Compose project. The doctor reads only the key names, in a throwaway
container that mounts the file read-only. Create those files with the host's own
secret tooling before deploying; PodoKit does not write them.

Required keys:

| Env file | Required keys |
| --- | --- |
| API | Profile-declared keys plus enabled dependency connection keys: `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |
| web | Only explicitly declared web keys; omitted by default |
| PostgreSQL dependency | `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB` |
| Redis dependency | `REDIS_PASSWORD` |
| Object storage dependency | `MINIO_ROOT_USER`, `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |

Data volumes are declared `external`, so `docker compose down -v` cannot delete the
database. Editing an env file changes the containers' rollout label, so the next
apply actually restarts them instead of leaving stale environment values running.
