 * The password the suite signs in with, per account.
 *
 * A test must never change an existing account's credentials. `seed.setup.ts` signs up
 * idempotently and then signs in with these values, which is right on a stack the suite
 * created — and wrong on every stack where the account already exists with a password of
 * its own. An install bootstrapped with `admin:bootstrap` is exactly that: `admin@example.com`
 * is a real account somebody logs in as, and resetting it to match the constant takes their
 * login with it while the run goes green.
 *
 * So the constant is a DEFAULT and the environment wins:
 *
 * ```bash
 * E2E_BASE_URL=https://app.example.com E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD='…' npx playwright test …
 * ```
 *
 * Without the override the run fails with `INVALID_EMAIL_OR_PASSWORD`, which is the correct
 * outcome — a refusal, not a silent overwrite. Do not commit a real value here.
