/** Admin-managed auth feature flags and their shipped defaults.
 *
 *  Kept free of Nest/TypeORM imports so both the DI-managed SettingsService and
 *  the better-auth feature gate (loaded by auth.ts, outside DI — including when
 *  the better-auth CLI evaluates auth.ts for migrations) can import it safely.
 *
 *  Must match the rows seeded by the InitAppSettings migration. phoneNumber is
 *  off by default because real delivery needs an SMS provider. */
